This is a project developed as part of the Trybe Web Development Course curriculum. The project consists of a web application for managing personal finances, allowing users to register transactions and track their spending over time.

The application was built using React and Redux, and uses an API to fetch exchange rates and currency conversion data. It includes a registration and login system, and allows users to add, remove and edit transactions, as well as visualize their spending in various formats such as charts and tables.
Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:

npm install

Then, start the development server using the command:

npm start

This will launch the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
Usage

To use the application, you will need to create an account by clicking on the "Sign Up" button on the login page. Once you have registered, you can log in and start adding transactions by clicking on the "New Transaction" button. You can choose the type of transaction (income or expense), the amount, the currency and the category.

The application will automatically convert the amount to your base currency based on the exchange rate data obtained from the API. You can view your transactions by clicking on the "Transactions" tab, and visualize your spending in various formats by clicking on the "Dashboard" tab.
